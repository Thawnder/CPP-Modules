# CPP Modules

**CPP Modules** is a series of projects at 42 School that introduces students to various concepts and features of C++. Each module focuses on a specific aspect of C++ programming, allowing students to gain practical experience through a series of exercises, which ends with an advanced yet optional one (which I obviously would do for all of them).

## Modules

### Module 00 - Introduction to C++ (100/100)
Introduction to the basics of C++ programming language, including data types, variables, operators, control structures, and functions.

### Module 01 - Memory Allocation (100/100)
Exploration of memory allocation in C++, covering stack vs. heap memory, dynamic memory allocation with `new` and `delete`, and smart pointers.

### Module 02 - Classes (100/100)
Introduction to classes and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, including encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, constructors, and destructors.

### Module 03 - Inheritance (100/100)
Deep dive into inheritance in C++, covering single inheritance, multiple inheritance, virtual inheritance, and the use of access specifiers.

### Module 04 - Subtype Polymorphism (100/100)
Understanding subtype polymorphism through virtual functions, pure virtual functions, abstract classes, and dynamic polymorphism using pointers and references.

### Module 05 - Ad-hoc Polymorphism (WIP)
Exploration of ad-hoc polymorphism, also known as function overloading and operator overloading, to create more expressive and concise code.

### Module 06 - Exceptions (WIP)
Introduction to exception handling in C++, including try-catch blocks, throw statements, exception specifications, and RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) principles.

### Module 07 - Templates (WIP)
Understanding template programming in C++, including function templates, class templates, template specialization, and template metaprogramming.

### Module 08 - Standard Template Library (STL) (WIP)
Exploration of the Standard Template Library (STL) in C++, covering containers (vectors, lists, maps, etc.), iterators, algorithms, and function objects.

### Module 09 - Advanced Topics (WIP)
Advanced topics in C++ programming, including move semantics, copy semantics, lambda expressions, rvalue references, and perfect forwarding.
